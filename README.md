This is my README file for regression exercises and my final project that will be Estimating Home Value. Using various methods learned in the Regression module, I will go through the data to present to the Zillow team my findings to predict the values of single unit properties that the tax district assesses using the property data from May-August 2017. As well present my findings for the distribution of tax rates for each county and show the states and counties they are listed in.
